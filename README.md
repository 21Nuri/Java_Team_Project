[Project description]   
----------
> We developed a Graphic Editor for this project. This Graphic Editor is similar to a typical drawing board. It allows for coordinate display and enables drawing with a pen, triangle, rectangle, and text on the canvas. Additionally, it allows adjusting the thickness and changing the color of the text or drawings.
